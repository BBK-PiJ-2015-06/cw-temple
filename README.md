Assignment 4

Completed as a pair?: No

Classes created: DijVertex, EscapeRunner, ShortestPathFinder, ExploreRunner,
GraphNode, PathBuilder, PathVertex

Classes modified: Explorer, and all classes that hold reference to a file 
path have been modified to reflect my personal file path to enable the program to
run on my computer.

Class structure: 2 new packages have been created in the student package;
escape and explore, each containing the classes relating to the separate
stages of completing the assignment. Also within each package is an archive
file which shows previous attempts at using concurrency / tree nodes etc
for solving the problems.
